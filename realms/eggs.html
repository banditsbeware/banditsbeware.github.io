		<p>Eggs are organic vessels in which embryos first begins to develop. Reptile eggs, bird eggs, and monotreme eggs, which are laid out of water, are surrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible. Eggs have been eaten by mankind for hundreds of thousands of years. Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken, duck, quail, roe, and caviar, but the egg most often consumed by humans is the chicken egg, by a wide margin.</p>
		<p>You will need to know the difference between Friday and a fried egg. It's quite a simple difference, but an important one. Friday comes at the end of the week, whereas a fried egg comes out of a chicken. Like most things, of course, it isn't quite that simple. The fried egg isn't properly a fried egg until it's been put in a frying pan and fried. This is something you wouldn't do to a Friday, of course, though you might do it on a Friday. You can also fry eggs on a Thursday, if you like, or on a cooker. It's all rather complicated, but it makes a kind of sense if you think about it for a while.</p>
		<p>I am egg and always will be, and we are eggs and always will be. Fried eggs. Or rotten eggs. Boiled eggs. Or scrambled eggs. Poached eggs. Or round eggs. Eggs. Eggs. Eggs.</p>
		<p>Going as if he trod upon eggs.</p>
		<p>A hen is only an egg's way of making another egg.</p>
		<p>'And how exactly like an egg he is!' she said aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall.<br>'It's very provoking,' Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking away from Alice as he spoke, 'to be called an egg — very!'<br>'I said you looked like an egg, Sir,' Alice gently explained. 'And some eggs are very pretty, you know,' she added, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of compliment.</p>
		<p>When she saw me cooking eggs, she thought I was back at it.</p>
		<p>The bird fights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world.</p>
		<p>A box without hinges, key or lid,<br>Yet golden treasure inside is hid.</p>
		<p>Better an egg today than a hen tomorrow.</p>
		<p>Don't put all your eggs in one basket.</p>
		<p>Eggs and oaths are soon broken.</p>
		<p>You can't have an omelette unless you break the egg.</p>
		<p>Augustus Leopold Egg RA (London 2 May 1816 – 26 March 1863 Algiers) was a Victorian artist best known for his modern triptych Past and Present (1858), which depicts the breakup of a middle-class Victorian family.</p>
		<p>Egg was born to Joseph and Ann Egg, and baptised in St James's Church, Piccadilly, on 30 May 1816. He had an elder brother, George Hine Egg.</p>
		<p>Egg's early paintings were generally illustrations of literary subjects. Like other members of The Clique, he saw himself as a follower of Hogarth.</p>
		<p>Unlike most other members of The Clique, Egg also admired the Pre-Raphaelites; he bought work from the young William Holman Hunt and shared ideas on color theory with him.</p>
